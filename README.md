Regular Expressions Hackathon goup15

## Project Description
Welcome to our regular expressions hackathon! Our team of junior full stack developers is working on an exciting project for a private organization. We have designed an API that aggregates data from various sources on the web and displays relevant information based on user requests.

## Objective
# The goal of this project is to extract different categories of data from hundreds of pages of text strings using regular expressions. Here are the types of data we need to extract:

Movie Titles
Song Lyrics
Twitter Usernames
ISBN Numbers
Jokes
TV Episode Titles
Dates in Strange Formats
Hex Color Codes
IP Addresses

## Example Regular Expressions

# Here's an example of regular expressions to extract movie titles:


Regular Expression: Title \(yyyy\)

Example Text String:
"The movie Titanic (1997) is a cinema classic."

Extraction Result:
- Title: "Titanic"
- Year: "1997"
